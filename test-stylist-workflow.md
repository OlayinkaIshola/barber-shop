# Elite Barber Shop - Stylist Registration & Approval Workflow Test

## ðŸŽ¯ **ENHANCED REGISTRATION TO STYLIST WORKFLOW**

The system has been enhanced so that when a barber registration is approved by an admin, it automatically creates a new stylist entry that appears in the stylists section and can be booked by customers.

## ðŸ“‹ **Complete Workflow:**

### **1. Barber Registration** âœ…
- Barber fills out registration form with professional details
- System creates User record with `role: 'barber'` and `registrationStatus: 'pending'`
- Barber cannot login or appear in stylists until approved

### **2. Admin Review & Approval** âœ…
- Admin logs into admin dashboard
- Reviews pending barber applications
- Can approve or reject with optional reason

### **3. Enhanced Approval Process** âœ…
When admin approves a barber, the system now:

#### **User Model Updates:**
- Sets `registrationStatus: 'approved'`
- Sets `isActive: true`
- Sets default availability schedule
- Sets default rating (4.5)
- Ensures bio exists with professional description

#### **Stylist Record Creation:**
- Creates new Stylist record linked to User
- Sets up enhanced stylist features:
  - Portfolio management
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Review system
  - Availability overrides
  - Payment preferences
  - Booking preferences

### **4. Immediate Stylist Availability** âœ…
- Approved barber immediately appears in `/stylists` page
- Can be selected for bookings
- Receives booking notifications
- Can access employee dashboard
