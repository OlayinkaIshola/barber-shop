## Expected Results
- ✅ New users can register and data is saved to database
- ✅ Users can login with saved credentials
- ✅ Authentication redirects work properly
- ✅ Employee dashboard loads user-specific data
- ✅ Bookings are created and stored in database
- ✅ All validation works (phone, email, password matching)

## API Endpoints Being Used
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create booking
- `GET /api/services` - Get services
- `GET /api/stylists` - Get stylists

## Notes
- Backend uses MongoDB Memory Server for development
- All data is stored in memory and will reset when backend restarts
- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage for authentication
- Phone and email validation is handled by backend
- Password matching is case-sensitive as requested
